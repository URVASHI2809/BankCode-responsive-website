                    <br>
                    At 14 years old my parents told me to become a Dental Hygienist/Dentist, so I did. An accident changed my life and my career. My passion for people and business has put my career on the fast track to massive success on a global scale. My decision to pursue a career in the business world led me to becoming one of the youngest CEOs in my industry. Then I chose to build my own management and consulting company.
                    
                    In 2013, I became a licensed and certified B.A.N.K. trainer with Codebreaker Technologies, a U.S. based sales training company that was expanding in Europe. By the end of that year, I had become the number one salesperson in the world and was offered the position of International Sales Director for Europe. In 2015 I was promoted to EVP of Global Sales, and then to President of the entire company.
                    
                    Today I’m the CEO and focused on working with top companies and organizations that are implementing B.A.N.K.™ to significantly increase their sales revenue & results. I work directly with the Founder, Cheri Tree, to source top speakers, coaches and trainers in multiple industries that want to become certified and licensed to teach B.A.N.K.™ in markets around the world. 
                    
                    <br>► Want to optimize your business and maximize your results? Our first business owner increased their sales by 185% in one year using B.A.N.K.
                    
                    <br>► Want to become a Certified Licensed B.A.N.K. Coach or Trainer? Codebreaker is looking for top leaders who want to coach, speak & train the B.A.N.K. system. 
                    
                    <br>► Want to become a strategic partner and add additional revenue streams? Codebreaker is looking for strategic relationships to help us expand in new markets. 
                    
                    <br>► Want to hire me on your Executive Advisory Board? I’d love to add value to your organization with my 20+ years of international experience in business.</p>
